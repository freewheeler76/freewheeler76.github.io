      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Stephen, but on the net I go by the handle freewheeler76.  I have had an interest in technology ever since I was in my late teens just when the internet was starting out in the mid 90's.  Over the last three years or so, thanks to the development of MOOC's, I have been able to fill in the gaps of my knowledge about technology.  So far I have completed around 12 (not all of them tech orientated) and because of them I have developed an interest in a number of areas:
      The impact of technology on society.
      The power of Social Media.
      The phenomenon of Big Data.
      Currently I am working through a series of self-paced courses on web design and development on Coursera offered by the University of Michigan.  I have found them very clear and well paced.  Since starting them, I have become more and more interested in web development, especially from an accessibility point of view.  Eventually I hope to be able to tie all my interests together somehow and make a career out of them.</p>
